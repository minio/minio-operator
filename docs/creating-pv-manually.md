We recommend using [`local` Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) as the backing storage for MinIO StatefulSets. MinIO
creates a distributed, resilient, failure tolerant storage system on `local` PVs. There is no explicit dependency on external distributed file systems or CSI vendors.

This document explains how to create `local` PVs. Once you create these PVs, MinIOInstance PVCs should automatically bind to these PVs.

## Getting Started

A `local` volume represents a mounted local storage device such as a disk, partition or directory.

Currently, `local` volumes can only be used as a statically created PersistentVolume. Dynamic provisioning is not supported yet. Compared to `hostPath` volumes, `local` volumes can be used in a durable and portable manner without manually scheduling Pods to nodes, as the system is aware of the volumeâ€™s node constraints by looking at the node affinity on the PersistentVolume.

Total number of `local` PVs required for a MinIOInstance is equal to Total Servers (across all zones) x Total Volumes Per Server. For example, if you have 4 zones, with 4 servers per zone and each server has 4 volumes, then total PVs required is 64. Since each server has 4 volumes, you'll need to create 4 `local` PVs, on all 16 Servers.

## Sample PV

This is a sample PV configuration. Note that `storageClassName` and `capacity` specified here should match the `storageClassName` and `capacity` specified in MinIOInstance `volumeClaimTemplate` for the PV and PVC to bind. Additionally, please change `capacity`, `path`, and `nodeAffinity` as per your specific requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: minio-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Ti
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: ""
  local:
    path: /mnt/disks/ssd1
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
    nodeSelectorTerms:
    - matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
        operator: In
        values:
        - example-node
```

After configuring the PV details, use `kubectl` to create the requisite number of PVs.
